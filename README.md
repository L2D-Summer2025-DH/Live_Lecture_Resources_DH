## üéì  **Live Lecture Instructor Notebooks**

Please find, in this repository, notebooks that we use for live coding in the live lectures for each lesson.

**Note**: These may have some inaccuracies from the instructor going back and forth in the notebook in an irregular way, for the purposes of demonstration in the lecture,itself. 

They are not a fully curated teaching resource, but if you follow along with the lecture videos theselves, they should make sense. 

The code in these are borrowed heavily from the online resources, so always refer to them when completing your assignment.

## üîç **How to Use**

Navigate to the folder pertaining to the lesson you want to review, and you will find it complete with any additional resources we introduced in the lecture. 

If you are loading any notebook or file, click on it, and you should see a download button in the top right of the screen. This will download the file or notebook to your local computer. From there you can use it in a local IDE such as VS Code. 

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Codespaces:**

If you are using a Codespace, you can manually upload it to your lesson's 'GitHub repository using the **Add file** button on the main page of your repo. If you haven't started your Codespace yet, starting one *after* you have uploaded these files, will ensure that they are present in your Codespace, and ready to use.

However, if you have already started a Codespace, you can open it, and directly drag the files and folders you wish to upload into the relevant folder in your Codespace's 'Explorer' tab (the icon of two pages of paper, on the toolbar on the left of the window). Then, to keep ensure they remain in your repository for the future, you can push and synchronise them back to your repo, just like you would when submitting an assignment. This repository provides safe, cloud-based storage for all your files - even after a Codespace has been decomissioned.
